version 0.4.0 (Mar 5, 2012)

Several optimizations and (minor) API changes by David McIntosh. We expect
that the API is backward compatible.

1) slight tweak to serialization to use the actualsizeinwords to set the buffer size when deserializing so it doesn't allocate more memory than it really needs.
2) added an orCardinality method that is a shortcut for bitmap1.or(bitmap2).cardinality() but doesn't need to create an intermediate bitmap.
3) added static or and orCardinality methods that can handle N number of bitmaps.  For example, bitmap1.or(bitmap2).or(bitmap3) could be done as EWAHCompressedBitmap.or(bitmap1, bitmap2, bitmap3).  It can be slower when N is small but avoids having to create N-2 intermediate bitmaps.
4) Long.bitCount is much faster when counting bits in the cardinality() method.

version 0.3.3 (Mar 2, 2012)

Correcting bug in intersect method (Robert Becho).

version 0.3.2 (Jan 16, 2012)

Better documentation and introduction 
of a few methods (intersects).

version 0.3.1 (Jan 2, 2012)

The code is now built using maven.

version 0.3 (Jun 21, 2011)

The code was optimized slightly for speed. 
You may a gain of about 20% on some operations, 
and no gain on other operations.


version 0.2 (Mar 4, 2011)

In this release, there is a minor change to the 
API: the getPositions method now returns an ArrayList 
instead of a Vector.

version 0.1 : was never released publicly.
