version 0.5.6 (October 5, 2012)
 - Improve performance of the IntIterator implementation (Colby Ranger)
 - Fix copyright notice (Google Inc. via Colby Ranger)

version 0.5.5 (October 5, 2012)
 - Fixed bug with new hashCode (from previous version), added unit test (Colby Ranger)
 - better example.java
 - new "bitmapOf" method (Colby Ranger)


version 0.5.4 (October 5, 2012)
 - Changed the semantics of "equals" to be more consistent with BitSet from the Java API. (Colby Ranger)


version 0.5.3 (August 7, 2012)
 - Correct a bug where the intersects method was returning false positives. The bug occurs when we attempt to add zero set bits to the stream of dirty words. Fixed / tested for 64 bit and 32 bit variants, also testing every flow through the and() method when called from intersects method.
 - Re-enable the testOrCardinality for the 64 bit variant.
 - Change behavior of NonEmptyException so we only throw the Exception if the number of dirty words is positive (and thus we are trying to set none).
 - Fix documentation in 32 bit impl.
 - remove unneeded returns in 64 bit implementation.

version 0.5.2 (July 9, 2012)
- Now being explicit about range of allowed set values, throws exceptions when out of range.


version 0.5.1 (May 28, 2012)
- Fixed minor performance regression.


version 0.5.0 (May 23, 2012)
- Added a 32-bit version of the compression scheme.


version 0.4.5 (May 21, 2012)
- Introduced the toArray method to retrieve set bits.


version 0.4.4 (May 21, 2012)
- Perf. boost when decoding bitmaps.

version 0.4.3 (April 9, 2012)

- fast aggregation through logical AND of many bitmaps using a new method 
- fixed a rarely occuring bug in the set method due to faulty bitmap size extension

version 0.4.2 (April 5, 2012)

* Fixed a bug with intersects method

version 0.4.1 (Mar 20, 2012)

* Resolved "EWAHCompressedBitmap.iterator() does not follow Java's contract for the Iterator interface"
* some performance enhancements for multi or.  array iteration is performing better than list iteration.
* documentation update


version 0.4.0 (Mar 5, 2012)

Several optimizations and (minor) API changes by David McIntosh. We expect
that the API is backward compatible, howerver serialization won't be
compatible with previous versions.

1) slight tweak to serialization to use the actualsizeinwords to set the buffer size when deserializing so it doesn't allocate more memory than it really needs.
2) added an orCardinality method that is a shortcut for bitmap1.or(bitmap2).cardinality() but doesn't need to create an intermediate bitmap.
3) added static or and orCardinality methods that can handle N number of bitmaps.  For example, bitmap1.or(bitmap2).or(bitmap3) could be done as EWAHCompressedBitmap.or(bitmap1, bitmap2, bitmap3).  It can be slower when N is small but avoids having to create N-2 intermediate bitmaps.
4) Long.bitCount is much faster when counting bits in the cardinality() method.

version 0.3.3 (Mar 2, 2012)

Correcting bug in intersect method (Robert Becho).

version 0.3.2 (Jan 16, 2012)

Better documentation and introduction 
of a few methods (intersects).

version 0.3.1 (Jan 2, 2012)

The code is now built using maven.

version 0.3 (Jun 21, 2011)

The code was optimized slightly for speed. 
You may a gain of about 20% on some operations, 
and no gain on other operations.


version 0.2 (Mar 4, 2011)

In this release, there is a minor change to the 
API: the getPositions method now returns an ArrayList 
instead of a Vector.

version 0.1 : was never released publicly.
